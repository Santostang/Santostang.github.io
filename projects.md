Kaggle Competitions
====================
![](/asset/kaggle.png) 

<a href="https://github.com/Santostang/kaggle-titanic" target="_blank">**Kaggle Titanic**</a> - The Kaggle Titanic competition revolved around taking in a dataset of all the passengers in the Titanic, and then predicting whether or not they survived. The features in the dataset included room location, age, gender, etc. For this competition, I used a variety of different supervised learning approaches (SVMs, KNNs, Decision Trees), but ultimately found that a KNN model (where K = 17) got the best accuracy of 78.95%. I used Numpy and Sklearn to help preprocess the data and create the models.
