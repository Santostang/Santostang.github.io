![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/asset/pandas.png)

## What is this?
It is a cheat sheet of Pandas by integrating all the cheat sheets of Pandas online. I made it because I need to memorize all the code to make me code faster without search on stackoverflow.

I have to thank the following cheat sheets
1. [Pandas_Cheat_Sheet by pandas-dev](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
2. [Pandas_Cheat_Sheet by dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/large_files/pandas-cheat-sheet.pdf)
3. [Pandas_Cheat_Sheet by Datacamp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf)
4. [Pandas_Cheat_Sheet2 by Datacamp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_Pandas_Cheat_Sheet_2.pdf)
5. [Pandas DataFrame Note by uidaho](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/504/Pandas%20DataFrame%20Notes.pdf)

## How to use?

I provided two versions of cheat sheet, one is with answer, one is without answer. You can use the one without answer to test yourself, and practice.
