I'm a master student in Cornell University and majoring in Information Science (focusing on Data Science). 

Before Cornell, I have worked for Prof. Lau Kin-nam as a data analyst at Chinese University of Hong Kong for two years. We cooperated with IBM in Big Data Plan A100, so I have led over 10 data projects for delivering data solutions for Fortune 500 companies. 

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of data analytics and machine learning in marketing and growth analytics where we can make better business decisions to create more value for users. Through two year working experience, I truly believe machine learning and data analytics can make an impact on user growth and marketing efficiency growth. If you're working in marketing or user growth analytics field, don't hesitate to reach out if cooperation opportunities. 

**Email me if you're looking to collaborate on projects. I'm also looking forward to full-time opportunities in data science and business intelligence.**
