I'm a master student at Cornell University and majoring in Information Science (focusing on Data Science). 

Before Cornell, I have worked for [Prof. Lau Kin-nam](http://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/index.php/schools-departments/marketing/faculty/part-time-faculty?pid=720&sid=230:Lau-Kin-nam) as a data analyst at Chinese University of Hong Kong for two years. We cooperated with IBM in [Big Data Plan A100](http://biz.ifeng.com/a/20160511/41606793_0.shtml), so I have **led over 10 data projects for delivering data solutions** for **Fortune 500 companies**. 

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of data analytics and machine learning in marketing and growth analytics where we can solve business problems. Through two year working experience, I truly believe machine learning and data analytics can make an impact on user growth and marketing efficiency growth. If you're working in marketing or user growth analytics field, don't hesitate to reach out if any cooperation opportunities. 

**[Email me](mailto:st883@cornell.edu) if you're looking to collaborate on projects. I'm also looking forward to full-time opportunities in data science and business intelligence.**
